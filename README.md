# Dynamic_poster

This project was developed as part of a Graduate-level seminar at Brown University on Data Visualization. This project was designed to develop a poster for an academic conference that could be displayed with a projector and white background so gifs and dynamic visuals could be included to supplement the work.

This repository was originally designed to work with the website rawgit, which would take the HTML/CSS files in the repository and render a functioning web page.

When academic work slows down, this repo will ideally shift over to another site, like pages.github.com, but until then it will live here
